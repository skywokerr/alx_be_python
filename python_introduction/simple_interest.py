# formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T)
#( I ) is the interest earned,
#( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
#( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
#( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.

principal = 1000 # representing $1000
rate = 0.05 # representing 5% annual interest rate
time = 3 # representing 3 years

interest = principal * rate * time
print("The simple interest is: " + str(interest))
